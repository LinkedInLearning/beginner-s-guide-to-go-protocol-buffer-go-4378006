Are you looking for alternatives to REST APIs to improve internal communication between services? In this course, instructor Martine Moses shows you how to create fast APIs using the Google Protocol Buffer (protobuf) and Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC), two of the most consistent, easy-to-use, open-source options for connecting and managing services across multiple platforms.

Explore the basics of protocol buffers and gRPCs, when to use which, how to define a protobuf, how to set up a gRPC, and more. Boost your career with in-demand skills that you can apply on your next job search, testing out your new technical know-how in the exercise challenges at the end of each section. Upon completing this course, youâ€™ll be ready to start defining protobuf messages and services, as well as creating gRPC servers and clients in both Go and TypeScript.



## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
